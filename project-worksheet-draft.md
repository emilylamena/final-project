**Draft Title:** Earthquake Hazards and Geohazard Interactions

**Group Members (2-3):** Casey Thibault, Lilli True, Emily LaMena

**âœ¨ Motivation:**
- Earthquakes are one of the most destructive geohazards, but their impacts extend far beyond ground shaking. They can trigger secondary effects such as tsunamis, landslides, or even influence volcanic activity. Understanding these interactions is crucial for hazard assessment, early warning systems, and risk mitigation strategies.

**ðŸ¤” Question and Hypothesis:** 
- Question â€“ How do earthquake characteristics influence the likelihood and severity of other geohazards? 
- Hypothesis â€“ larger-magnitude and shallower earthquakes occurring near subduction zones will have a higher probability of generating tsunamis while those occurring near active volcanic regions may correlate with increased volcanic unrest. 

**ðŸ“ˆ How are you going to answer/test:**
- We will look at USGS data on Earthquake seismicity as well as tsunami data from NOAA and volcanic activity records from the Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program. We will perform correlational analysis to assess relationships between hazards and map spatial relationships between events. This could help in the identification of key earthquake characteristics that serve as strong predictors of secondary geohazards, with applications for risk mitigation and warning systems.
